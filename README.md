# Project Gallery

A card interface gallery of all my projects. Included in each card is an image, a description and links to the relevant github pagesand repository. The amount of cards per row is reduced depending on screen width and each card expands to reveal the description text.

Using .addEventListener, .querySelector and .classlist.add for the first time, I created a function that changes the class of the element between 2 styles as well as swapping the button textarea between "+Expand" and "-Collapse".
